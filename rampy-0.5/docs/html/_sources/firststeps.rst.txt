First Steps
===========

You can consult the help of each function/class/method on this website, please click on the *rampy package* item on the navigation bar on the left side.

Below, some quick examples of the use of those functions/classes are shown to highlight some of the possibilities offered by Rampy.

For complete examples of use, please directly see the `example Jupyter notebooks here <https://github.com/charlesll/rampy/tree/master/examples>`_

Library importation
-------------------

Python does not come with a lot of possibilities. This is why you usually need to import a few libraries. You can assign a shortname to a library, as usually people import/use functions with libraries' prefix, to avoid confusion (two libraries can have a function with the same name...). A useful shortname for rampy is ``rp``:

.. code-block:: python

  # importing rampy
  import rampy as rp
  # and for numpy we will respect the usual name:
  import numpy as np
  # for matplotlib
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Data importation
----------------

This is done using directly Pandas or numpy, except for:
- importing multiple spectra can be done with the ``rampy.spectrarray()`` function;
- maps for which rampy provides a function to import the CSV files generated by
the Renishaw or Horiba Raman spectrometers.

To import a spectrum saved in a 2 column text file "data.txt" with space separator, we can use the numpy genfromtxt function:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  spectrum = np.genfromtxt("data.txt")

If our file has a 10 line header, we can skip it like

.. code-block:: python

  spectrum = np.genfromtxt("data.txt", skip_header=10)

See the documentation of numpy for further details, as well as that of Pandas.

Plot a spectrum
---------------

This can be done with Matplotlib directly. For instance, to plot our spectrum we can do:

.. code-block:: python

  plt.figure(figsize=(5,5))
  plt.plot(spectrum[:,0],spectrum[:,1],'k.',markersize=1)
  plt.xlabel("Raman shift, cm$^{-1}$", fontsize = 12)
  plt.ylabel("Normalized intensity, a. u.", fontsize = 12)
  plt.title("Fig. 1: the raw data",fontsize = 12,fontweight="bold")

This will give the image:

.. image:: ./images/spectrum.png
  :width: 400
